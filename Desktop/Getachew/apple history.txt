         The second book Essay:
 
     Who move my cheese could tell us clearly & loudly about how peoples respond for changes ,as we see earlier we get three different groups based on acepting or respond for changes also, so from those Hem was so riged to adopt or accept change . I think most peoples are under Hem catagorize or can say have behaviour of Hem,thats why a few peoples only successful in the world or our surrounding , who they can transform themselves on the situation on good timing too.
   In this Apple history ,Hem was showing good accomplishement ,eventhough he was trying give up or refrain from his way to new cheese station , in the help of Hope , she was gifted from God (its my belife , am not saying with out any trying to do something God will give you what ever you want , its also Bible also tells us try your effert ,i ll be behind of your effort) ,she was miracle to him , she helps out him a lot , by giving back his breath with her Apple (vegeterian), but he was fully loaded with suspecious mind , even his friend Haw , actually , suspecious is not bad but dont affraid , instead trying escaping mechanism for the worst senario , that will make us problem solver ,unless we can't do anything with suspecious thinking . Hem has negative thinking on outcomes , he didnt try anything but he thinks if i cant that cheese , am gonna die , he can't learn a lesson even he can live without it ,but Hope give him apple also help him to live , so expecting negative will never lead you better life instead you thinking old belifs, there is one Ethiopian narration about hope "wish better , to get better thing " , am not sure i discourse in descriptive way , but can feels like being optimistic.
  Hem was strongly fighting with his old belifs and also he didnt convinced on his wrong idea , he blames on his traumatic , but its not good behaviour . I remember the Alibaba owner Jack was saying on one Tv show s ,for young generation about failure to change ,"Don't blame other for your failour , just convince thats because of you and try get a good lesson to come up again with failor free idea ", its wonderfull speech , thats why he get the current status. Hope told him get ride of his old belifs and keep going to his new cheese station ,what finally arrived , so it has more bending line to get somewhere destination but with good moral and hope , will be reach soon .I wish to know how will be Hem next status for how he accepting change .
   It was wonderfull lesson , i can share about changes to other Hem's.

             thanks Mr Kaleb
